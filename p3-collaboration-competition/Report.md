# Project 3: Collaboration and Competition Report

Here I describe the implementation coded for solving the collaboration-competition [Unity Tennis](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/master/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#tennis) environment.

### Learning Algorithm
The chosen algorithm for this project is a Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG). It is an actor-critic algorithm and uses one neural network for the actor and another for the critic.

### Plot of Rewards

### Ideas for Future Work
As future work and ideas it can be considered to:
- Experiment with other network sizes.
